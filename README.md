a program for earthquakes and micro-earthquakes detection  
it has three fundamental partsï¼š  
1 detect earthquakes using improved phaseNet and array strategy  
2 detect micro-earthquakes based on GPU-WMFT  
3 calculate travel time difference by cross-correlation  and provide input files for tomoDD

As we develop this program in our research, it also contains many functions.  if not needed, you can ignore other part. any way, the reorgainizing work is going on and we would try to give a better way for users who need this kind of functions.
